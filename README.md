## Introduction
ORGANA is a Robotic assistant that provides a seamless interaction between SDLs and chemists for diverse chemistry experiments. It perceives the objects and the progress of the chemistry task to make an informed decision for the next steps of the chemistry experiment. Informed decisions, guided by user intention and perception, are a key strength. ORGANA optimizes SDL efficiency through parallel experiment execution, providing timely feedback via reports and analysis, thus keeping users well-informed and involved in high-level decision-making.
